## Why do we need the wallet-to-wallet chat?

Web3 has successfully made the security and privacy of millions of blockchain users in a new way. Instead of logging in with your email, just connect your wallet to keep your personal information private. 

However, there are many trends and technology invented, such as DeFi, GameFi, NFT, and Layer2. But we still do not have a way to send messages to other blockchain users. 

Using Twitter, Discord, or Telegram to communicate is not a problem. The issue is proving ownership of crypto assets associated with the accounts. How can you be sure that the person you are talking to on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and the owner of that wallet address is the same person?

Lack of transparency and ambiguity in proving ownership makes it hard to build trust and sustainable relationships in web3 communities.

Now, it's time to step up and fix it. 

## Usecase

Buidler is a web3 native messaging platform, which means we have the power of cryptography for secure and on-chain data to keep things transparent for your community. Let’s take a look at something cool about communicating on Buidler:

Let's look at buying and selling NFTs as an example.

Direct wallet-to-wallet messaging is a convenient way to communicate with NFT owners when buying and selling. The feature allows for negotiating prices and arranging meetups. Buidler offers a simple buying and selling experience without the need for switching to any wallet or exchange.

### 5/ End-to-end encrypted direct messages

End-to-end encryption keeps your direct messages, images, videos, and files private. Only you and the person you're talking to can read them. Your private key and the other person's key unlock the encryption, so even we can't see what's inside.
