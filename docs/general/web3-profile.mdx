## Why do we need the Buidler Web3 Profile?

Our profile page offers the perfect blend of the strength of Web2 and Web3 to help you share your trustless profile with everyone. There are several reasons why you should use our platform:

### 1/ Make your audience feel and stay secure.

Having a large social media audience makes you a target for scammers who may impersonate you and trick your followers into visiting phishing websites to steal their assets.

In Buidler, your profile is linked to your wallet address. This ensures that any links or information you post on your profile are connected to your wallet address. As your wallet holds tokens, NFTs, or Soul bound tokens (SBTs), people can differentiate your account from scam accounts at the first glance. 

To keep your information secure, we ask for your wallet signature before making any changes to your profile. After that, the changes will be saved on IPFS, where everyone can see them. This way, your profile is verifiable and unalterable, ensuring your identity remains safe and secure.

### 2/ Simplify sharing with a single link.

Builder Profile lets you bring all your online content from various platforms and chains into one place. You can showcase your projects and provide your followers with easy access to official links to your websites, social media accounts, whitepapers, team members, smart contracts, and more. Provide a hub that is easy to navigate and provides a wealth of information to your followers.

### 3/ Brings DApps to thousands of audience

With the web3 native platform, you can integrate various DApps such as Uniswap, Opensea, Snapshot, and more into your profile page. Your audience can buy, sell, mint, swap, and do whatever they can to get more people involved in the project.

By making things easier for your followers, giving them a smoother experience, and removing barriers, you can attract many participants and spread your community's values to people all over the world.
