At Buidler, we're all about the power of the community. By harnessing collective power, we can identify potential threats and evaluate the quality of various entities on our platform. This includes evaluating a wallet address, a smart contract of a project, and even URLs that may be relevant to scams and other issues.

By doing this in a decentralized and community-driven way, Buidler can harness the collective power of our users to create a safer and more reliable platform for everyone.

## Why does community power matter?

Scammers are everywhere - on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Facebook, and other platforms. 
We are also victims of scammers, harassed every day.

Here are two reasons why we need to harness collective power:

### 1/ By community, for community
To fight against scams, we will not censor or control user content like centralized platforms.

Instead, we rely on collective efforts to keep the platform safe for everyone, while ensuring the principle of censorship resistance on the web3.

Buidler will aggregate all reports and votes on potential scams contributed by members and other resources. Then, we will create a shared blacklist of fraudulent activities. If harmful content is detected in any conversations on Buidler, we will take immediate action by sending out a warning to all members.

The blacklist serves as a safety net for our platform. By working together, we can create a secure environment where everyone can safely and thrive.

### 2/ Seamless information flow

Many communities have made efforts to address scams in their communities.

But the reality is that these efforts are scattered and ineffective. 

Each community has its own **"#ðŸš¨scam-report"** channel, and the report is only valid within that community because there is no central database for all communities to access and contribute together.

</div>

And, of course, web 2.0 platforms won't provide that data to you.

Imagine a scenario where a scammer is reported in one community. They can then move to another community and continue their fraudulent activities. Lack of coordination and information sharing can worsen detection and reporting accuracy.

At Buidler, we have a common database for seamless sharing among all communities.

## Usecase
### 1/ Buidler Inspector

As part of this vision, Buidler Inspector is an assistant for all communities, helping to detect conversations that contain suspicious content such as addresses, smart contracts, URLs, and alerting members immediately to be careful.

Moreover, Buidler Inspector also marks profiles with addresses related to scams for easy identification by everyone. Even if you accidentally send money to a wallet address or contract that is marked as a scam, Buidler Inspector will remind you, protecting you from potential scams.

And here are some summary points for you:

- **Protect immediately:** warn people immediately to avoid clicking on any links related to scams.
- **Decentralized and community-driven:** all members have the power to decide which entities are good or bad. Data collected is public for everyone, and contributions to report cases of fraud are incentivized.
- **The data source is always fresh:** it is continuously provided by members of the community, ensuring that it is always up-to-date.
