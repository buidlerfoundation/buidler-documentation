## What problems do we solve?

### **1./ Social media scams are all too common**

According to a US Federal Trade Commission [report](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze), over $1 billion has been lost to crypto scams since the start of 2021, with most starting from social media platforms. Inexperienced crypto users are often targeted with copycat websites, URLs, accounts, hacked verified accounts, fake projects, fake airdrops, malware, and other scams

This top-priority issue needs to be resolved from Day 1 of Buidler. 

However, as a web3 platform, we strongly stick to the principle of web3, which is to promote **Censorship Resistance**. Therefore, we will not censor or control user-generated content.

Instead, it has a system to flag and alert users of harmful content that may be present on our platform, such as URLs, addresses, smart contracts, or tokens, to protect them from scams.

All communities will be empowered to contribute to keeping it constantly up to date, ensuring it can detect any new threats. Fighting against bad actors is an ongoing battle, and we cannot do it alone.

### **2./  Lack of sharing and connection**

Web3 communities are still operating independently and lacking in connection. Most communities are built around a project or a famous individual, so sharing knowledge and information is still limited and not synchronized.

One example of this is the reporting of scammers. Currently, each community has its own **"#scam-report"** channel, but there is no central database for evaluating addresses, profiles, and scam teams. This lack of coordination and information sharing can result in slower detection and inaccurate reporting.

Building a shared database and promoting information sharing among Web3 communities can help detect and report scammers and other bad actors, harnessing the collective power of the community to make the world safer and more connected.

## Usecase

### 1./ Buidler Inspector

As part of this vision, Buidler Inspector is an assistant in all communities, helping identify URLs, address scams in messages, and warn all community members.

- **Protect immediately:** warn people immediately to avoid clicking on any links related to scams.
- **The data source is always fresh:** the data will be continuously provided by members of the community, ensuring that it is always up-to-date.
- **Community-driven, open source:** data collected is public for everyone, and contributions to report cases of fraud are incentivized.
