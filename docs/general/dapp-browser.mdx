# DApp Browser

Buidler DApp Browser is a more efficient and secure way for your members to explore decentralized applications without ever leaving your community.

With each browser located directly in the chat channel, you can easily organize trusted websites, social accounts, and DApps. That way, your members can effortlessly access and interact with the legit links without worrying about clicking on suspicious links.
