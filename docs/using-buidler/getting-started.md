Builder is a web3 native platform, meaning your account is identified by your wallet address, not an email address, phone number, or password like in traditional web2 platforms.

To access Buidler, you can connect your wallet in several ways:

1. **Create a New Wallet**:  If you don't have a wallet, don't worry! Buidler's iOS and macOS apps support creating one. With Buidler as your crypto wallet, you can store, send, and receive tokens, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies. This is a great option for those who don't already have a wallet.

2. **Import Your Wallet**: If you already have a wallet, you can quickly import it to Buidler. The platform now supports importing wallets with seed phrases on both iOS and macOS. 

3. **Login via MetaMask and WalletConnect**: This option is ideal for those who already have a wallet and want to keep using the same provider. Simply connect your MetaMask or WalletConnect wallet to Buidler and start exploring the platform. Note that, at the moment, Buidler only supports these logins on the browser.

4. **Login via Social Login**: Buidler is also integrating with Web3auth, which enables you to login via social platforms like Facebook, Discord, Apple, and Google. This is a convenient option for those who want to use their existing social accounts to access Buidler.
